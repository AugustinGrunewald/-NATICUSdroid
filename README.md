A study of the NATICUSdroid (Android Permissions) dataset.

Available at : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/722/naticusdroid+android+permissions+dataset

The dataset contains permissions extracted from more than 29000 benign & malware Android apps released between 2010-2019.
In this study, we aim to analyze the permissions declared in all these benign and malware apps. We would like to reveal the most significant and trending permissions, including both native and custom ones.

The final goal is to identify the approach that yields the best possible results for predicting whether a new application is malware or not. To do so, after studying the data and cleaning it if necessary, we will implement and evaluate several different machine learning methods.
